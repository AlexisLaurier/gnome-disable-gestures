# gnome-disable-gestures
A GNOME extension that disable all GNOME built-in gestures. Useful for kiosks and touch screen apps.

The original implementation of [Disable Gestures][1] extension by [mattbell87] doesn't
work when [single-finger drag down from top of the screen][2]. [katastrophal] had provided
[an implementation][3] at reddit and [osoplex] also provided [another implementation][4]
at reddit too. Unfortunately none of these implementation has published to extensions.gnome.org.

This repo is created for the purpose to publish the extension.
